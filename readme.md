# üìò REST API Concepts and Best Practices

This guide covers essential REST API principles, corrected explanations, and clear examples to help you master designing robust and efficient APIs.

---

## üß© What is an API, and Why Do We Use It?

### ü§î What is an API?

**API** stands for **Application Programming Interface**. Think of it as a **messenger** between two software systems. It allows them to talk to each other, exchange data, and work together.

> In simple terms: An API is like a **waiter** in a restaurant. You (the client) give an order, and the waiter (API) brings it to the kitchen (server) and returns the food (data).

### üß† Why Do We Use APIs?

APIs solve a very common problem: **how can different systems talk to each other without knowing the internal details of one another?**

### ‚úÖ What Problems Do APIs Solve?

* Hide complex internal logic (you don‚Äôt need to know how the kitchen works)
* Allow systems written in different languages to communicate
* Reuse functionality easily (e.g., Google Maps, payment gateways)
* Securely control access to features and data

### üí° Real-World Examples:

* üß≠ **Google Maps API**: You can embed a map in your app or website without building mapping tech from scratch.
* üí≥ **Stripe API**: Allows websites to accept payments without handling sensitive banking logic directly.
* üì¶ **Weather API**: Apps like a weather widget use it to fetch real-time weather data.
* üì± **Mobile Apps**: Instagram‚Äôs mobile app uses APIs to communicate with Instagram‚Äôs servers to load posts, likes, comments, etc.

### üîÅ Example:

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre building an app that shows cat facts.

When you open the app, it makes this request:

```http
GET https://catfact.ninja/fact
```

The API responds with:

```json
{
  "fact": "Cats sleep 70% of their lives."
}
```

Your app shows this text to the user.

## 1. ‚úÖ CRUD Operations in REST APIs

**CRUD** stands for:

* **Create**  ‚Üí `POST`
* **Read**    ‚Üí `GET`
* **Update**  ‚Üí `PUT` (full) / `PATCH` (partial)
* **Delete**  ‚Üí `DELETE`

These operations map directly to HTTP methods:

| HTTP Method | CRUD Operation | Description                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| POST        | Create         | Add a new resource             |
| GET         | Read           | Retrieve one or more resources |
| PUT         | Update         | Replace a resource entirely    |
| PATCH       | Update         | Modify specific fields only    |
| DELETE      | Delete         | Remove a resource              |

### Example:

```http
POST /users          # Create a user
GET /users/12        # Get user with ID 12
PUT /users/12        # Replace user with ID 12
PATCH /users/12      # Update part of user with ID 12
DELETE /users/12     # Remove user with ID 12
```

---

## 2. üñÅ PUT vs PATCH

* **PUT**: Updates the entire resource. If any field is missing in the request body, it might be overwritten.

  * *Example:* Update a full user profile.

```json
PUT /users/5
{
  "name": "Ali",
  "email": "ali@example.com",
  "age": 25
}
```

* **PATCH**: Updates only specific fields.

  * *Example:* Only changing the email:

```json
PATCH /users/5
{
  "email": "new@email.com"
}
```

Use **PATCH** for efficiency when doing partial updates.

## 3. üìä Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code | Meaning               | When to Use                       |
| ---- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK                    | Request succeeded                 |
| 201  | Created               | Resource created (usually POST)   |
| 204  | No Content            | Success with no response body     |
| 400  | Bad Request           | Client error (malformed request)  |
| 401  | Unauthorized          | Invalid or missing authentication |
| 403  | Forbidden             | Authenticated but not authorized  |
| 404  | Not Found             | Resource does not exist           |
| 409  | Conflict              | Conflict in resource state        |
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Server-side error                 |

## 4. üìÜ Statelessness in REST APIs

REST APIs are **stateless**, meaning:

* Each request must contain all necessary data (like tokens).
* The server does **not remember** previous requests or sessions.

### Benefits:

* Easier to scale
* Simpler server logic

### Example:

Each request must send the auth token:

```http
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer abc123
```

---

## 5. üîê Securing REST APIs

### Best practices:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**

   * Use tokens: API keys, JWT, OAuth2.

2. **Rate Limiting**

   * Prevent abuse using tools like Redis + Nginx or API gateways.

3. **Input Validation**

   * Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, etc.

4. **HTTPS (TLS/SSL)**

   * Encrypt all data in transit.

5. **Data Encryption at Rest**

   * Use encryption for databases, logs, backups.

---

## 6. üìå API Versioning

Versioning helps you evolve APIs without breaking existing clients.

### Strategies:

* **URL-based** (most common)

  * `/api/v1/users`
* **Query parameters**

  * `/users?version=2`
* **Custom headers**

  * `Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v2+json`

### Why version?

* Allow safe feature rollouts
* Enable backward compatibility
* Serve different client needs

---

## 7. üìö Pagination in REST APIs

Used to split large datasets into smaller parts for performance.

### Common Strategies:

1. **Limit/Offset Pagination**:

```http
GET /items?limit=10&offset=20
```

2. **Page Number Pagination**:

```http
GET /items?page=3&size=10
```

3. **Cursor-based Pagination**:

```http
GET /items?cursor=eyJpZCI6MjB9
```

4. **Keyset Pagination (High Performance)**:

```http
GET /items?after_id=100&limit=10
```

---

## 8. ‚è±Ô∏è Rate Limiting

Rate limiting controls how many requests a client can send in a given time window. It protects APIs from abuse, ensures fair usage, and keeps performance stable.

### üîπ Why It's Important:

* Prevents denial-of-service attacks
* Ensures equitable resource access
* Maintains server reliability under high traffic

### ‚öôÔ∏è Common Rate Limiting Algorithms:

1. **Fixed Window Counter**

   * A simple counter resets every interval (e.g., per minute).
   * Example: Allow 100 requests per minute.
   * Downside: Bursts at the edge of time windows.

   ```text
   At 12:00 ‚Üí 100 requests allowed
   At 12:01 ‚Üí Counter resets, another 100 allowed
   ```

2. **Sliding Log**

   * Stores timestamps of each request and filters those within the time window.
   * Very accurate, but memory-intensive at scale.

   ```text
   For each request, store timestamp.
   Count how many in the last 60 seconds.
   Allow if under the limit.
   ```

3. **Sliding Window Counter**

   * Smooth version of Fixed Window.
   * Divides time into small slices and weights them.

   ```text
   If 70 requests in last minute:
   - 40 from this window slice
   - 30 from the previous
   Use weighted total to decide.
   ```

4. **Token Bucket** *(Most Flexible)*

   * Tokens are added to a bucket at a fixed rate.
   * Each request consumes a token.
   * If tokens run out, requests are blocked until more tokens refill.

   ```text
   Bucket holds 100 tokens.
   10 tokens added/sec.
   1 request = 1 token.
   Can burst if tokens are available.
   ```

### üî¢ Example Rate Limit Headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 42
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1690000000
```

These headers help clients understand their current usage and when limits reset.

## 9. üñÅ What is Idempotency and Why Does It Matter?

**Idempotency** means that no matter how many times you repeat the same request, the result stays the same ‚Äî as if you did it once.

### Why is this important?

Imagine you send a request to delete a user. If your internet glitches and you accidentally send the delete request twice, idempotency makes sure the user is deleted only once ‚Äî not causing errors or duplicate actions.

### Which HTTP methods are idempotent?

- **Idempotent:** `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`  
  You can repeat these safely.

- **Not idempotent:** `POST`  
  Sending a POST multiple times usually creates multiple resources.

- **PATCH**  
  Sometimes idempotent, depends on how it‚Äôs used.

---

### Simple examples:

- `DELETE /users/12`  
  Deleting user 12 once or multiple times results in the same state ‚Äî user 12 is gone.

- `PUT /profile` with the same data  
  Updating your profile with the same info repeatedly won‚Äôt change anything after the first update.

- `POST /orders`  
  Sending this request twice usually creates two orders ‚Äî so it‚Äôs **not** idempotent.

---

### Summary:

| HTTP Method | Idempotent? | What happens if you repeat?                 |
|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| GET         | Yes         | You get the same data every time            |
| PUT         | Yes         | Resource stays the same after first update  |
| DELETE      | Yes         | Resource is deleted (only once)              |
| POST        | No          | Creates new resources every time             |
| PATCH       | Sometimes   | Depends on what you change                    |

Idempotency helps your app handle retries safely without breaking things or creating duplicates.

## 10. üöÄ Improving API Performance

### Techniques:

1. **Client-side Caching**

   * Use `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, `Cache-Control` headers

2. **Server-side Caching**

   * Use Redis, Memcached for frequently requested data

3. **CDN Caching**

   * Cache static content near the user

4. **Database Optimization**

   * Add indexes, optimize queries, avoid N+1 problems

5. **Connection Pooling**

   * Reuse DB or HTTP connections to reduce overhead

6. **Compression**

   * Use Gzip/Brotli to reduce response sizes

7. **Efficient Serialization**

   * Consider Protocol Buffers or MessagePack for large payloads

---

## 11. üìù Documenting REST APIs

Well-documented APIs improve adoption and usability.

### Best Practices:

* Use **OpenAPI (Swagger)** for interactive docs
* Describe each endpoint:

  * Request methods and URLs
  * Query parameters and headers
  * Request and response examples
  * Error status codes

### Example Toolchain:

* [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
* [Redoc](https://redoc.ly/)
* [Postman Collections](https://www.postman.com/)
